[Pseudoinstructions](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/Mips/pseudo.html)

Pseudo instructions are parsed by the assembler into multiple real instructions. Performance-wise, pseudo instructions should not be real instructions, but it is more difficult for programmers to work sans them. Pseudo instructions do not correspond with real instructions.

TL;DR: "Pseudoinstructions not only make it easier to program, it can also add clarity to the program, by making the intention of the programmer more clear."
